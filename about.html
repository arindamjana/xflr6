    Background in math and econ, work almost exclusively in urban science and spatial economics, with significant recent explorations in the green economy. Currently based out of Cape Town. Entered the PhD game a little late in life, but trying very hard to wrap it up soon. My research is on intra-city spatial inequalities, where, simply put, I show that when making spatial/location choices in the City, adding even one more dimension to the decision matrix can result in significant welfare gains. Constantly dabbling with data, though somewhat tired of coding-for-a-living. In my spare time, I experiment a fair bit in the kitchen, and try my hand at woodworking. Also a fan of a good fine-nibbed fountain pen, long-form cricket, graphic novels, quizzing, a good whisky, and crosswords - the preference ranking, however, keeps changing.
